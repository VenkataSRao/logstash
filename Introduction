Logstash is an open source tool for collecting, parsing, and storing logs for future use. Kibana is a web interface 
that can be used to search and view the logs that Logstash has indexed. Both of these tools are based on Elasticsearch.


Using Elasticsearch as a backend datastore, and kibana as a frontend reporting tool, Logstash acts as the workhorse, 
creating a powerful pipeline for storing, querying and analyzing your logs. With an arsenal of built-in inputs, filters, 
codecs and outputs, you can harness some powerful functionality with a small amount of effort.
